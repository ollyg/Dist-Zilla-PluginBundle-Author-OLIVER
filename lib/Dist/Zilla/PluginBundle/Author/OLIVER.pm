# ABSTRACT: Dists like OLIVER's

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the plugin bundle that OLIVER uses. It is equivalent to:

 [MetaResourcesFromGit]
  
 [ReadmeFromPod]
 [@Filter]
 -bundle = @Basic
 -remove = Readme
  
 [AutoVersion]
 [NextRelease]
 [PkgVersion]
 [PickyPodWeaver]
 [AutoPrereqs]
 [MetaJSON]

 [PruneFiles]
 filenames = dist.ini
  
 [Git::CommitBuild]
 branch =
 release_branch = master
 message = <changelog section content>
  
 [@Git]
 commit_msg = Bumped changelog following rel. v%v 

=head1 RATIONALE

The intention is to have a sane L<http://github.com> layout and at the same
time supporting CPAN upload.

Development take place on a C<devel> branch at GitHub and then releases are
committed to the C<master> branch which is the default for user access. Commit
messages to the C<master> are the content of the latest section in the
C<Changes> file.

Use of the L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaResourcesFromGit> plugin creates links
at CPAN which point to the GitHub pages (the wiki page is used as the default
Homepage).

A minor customization to the L<Pod::Weaver> plugin restricts POD munging only
to those files containing an C<ABSTRACT> statement.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

If you provide the C<no_cpan> option with a true value to the bundle, or set
the environment variable C<NO_CPAN> to a true value, then the upload to CPAN
will be suppressed.

If you provide a value to the C<major_version> option then it will be passed
to the C<AutoVersion> Plugin as the C<major> attribute.

If you provide a value to the C<skip_deps> option then it will be passed to
the C<AutoPrereqs> Plugin as the C<skip> attribute.

If you provide a value to the C<skip_files> option then it will be passed to
the C<PruneFiles> Plugin as the C<match> attribute.

If you provide one or more instaces of the C<skip_plugin> option, then the
values will be removed from the list of plugins imported from the C<@Basic>
Plugin Bundle.

=head1 TIPS

Do not include a C<NAME>, C<VERSION>, C<AUTHOR> or C<LICENSE> POD section in
your code, they will be provided automatically. However please do include an
abstract for documented libraries via a comment like so:

 # ABSTRACT: here is my abstract statement

The bundle is desgined for projects which are hosted on C<github>. More so,
the project should have a C<master> branch which is where the I<built> code
is committed, and a I<separate> branch where you do code development. The
module author uses a C<devel> branch for this purpose. On C<github> you can
then leave the C<master> branch as the default branch for web browsing.
