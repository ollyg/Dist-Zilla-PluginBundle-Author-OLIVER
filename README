NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::OLIVER - Dists like OLIVER's

VERSION
    version 1.103610

DESCRIPTION
    This is the plugin bundle that OLIVER uses. It is equivalent to:

     [MetaResourcesFromGit]
      
 [ReadmeFromPod]
     [@Filter]
     -bundle = @Basic
     -remove = Readme

     [NextRelease]
     [PkgVersion]
     [PodWeaver]
     [AutoPrereqs]
      
 [PruneFiles]
     filenames = dist.ini
      
 [Git::CommitBuild]
     branch =
     release_branch = master
      
 [@Git]
     commit_msg = %c

CONFIGURATION
    If you provide the "no_cpan" option with a true value to the bundle, or
    set the environment variable "NO_CPAN" to a true value, then the upload
    to CPAN will be suppressed.

TIPS
    Do not include a "NAME", "VERSION", "AUTHOR" or "LICENSE" POD section in
    your code, they will be provided automatically. However please do
    include an abstract for documented libraries via a comment like so:

     # ABSTRACT: here is my abstract statement

    The bundle is desgined for projects which are hosted on "github". More
    so, the project should have a "master" branch which is where the *built*
    code is committed, and a *separate* branch where you do code
    development. The module author uses a "devel" branch for this purpose.
    On "github" you can then leave the "master" branch as the default branch
    for web browsing.
