NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::OLIVER - Dists like OLIVER's

VERSION
    version 1.103581

DESCRIPTION
    The is the plugin bundle that OLIVER uses. It is equivalent to:

     [MetaResources]
     homepage       = http://github.com/ACCOUNT/DIST/wiki
     bugtracker.web = https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=DIST
     repository.url = git://github.com/ACCOUNT/DIST.git
     
 [ReadmeFromPod]
     [@Filter]
     -bundle = @Basic
     -remove = Readme
     
 [AutoVersion]
     [NextRelease]
     [PkgVersion]
     [PodWeaver]
     [AutoPrereqs]
     
 [PruneFiles]
     filenames = dist.ini
     
 [Git::CommitBuild]
     branch =
     release_branch = master

     [@Git]
     commit_msg = %c

CONFIGURATION
    In the above, "DIST" will be substituted for the value of the "name"
    option in your "dist.ini" file. Also, "ACCOUNT" will be substituted for
    your <http://github.com> account name. Both of these can be overriden by
    providing the "dist" or "account" options to this Bundle in "dist.ini".

    If you provide the "no_cpan" option with a true value to the bundle,
    then the upload to CPAN will be suppressed.

TIPS
    Do not include a "NAME", "VERSION", "AUTHOR" or "LICENSE" POD section in
    your code, they will be provided automatically. However please do
    include an abstract for documented libraries via a comment like so:

     # ABSTRACT: here is my abstract statement

    The bundle is desgined for projects which are hosted on "github". More
    so, the project should have a "master" branch which is where the *built*
    code is committed, and a *separate* branch where you do code
    development. The module author uses a "devel" branch for this purpose.
    On "github" you can then leave the "master" branch as the default branch
    for web browsing.
